# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Detailed examples of overused, tired, or lazy design patterns. Reference when evaluating work.

## Visual Clichés

### Gradients
- Heavy purple-to-blue gradients on white backgrounds (the "2020 SaaS" look)
- Oversaturated mesh gradients used without purpose
- Rainbow gradients that feel like a filter, not a decision

**When gradients work:** Subtle, purposeful, serving the brand. A single-hue gradient for depth. A gradient that's integral to the identity.

### Bevels and Glass
- Heavily beveled edges on every element
- Glassmorphism applied universally without restraint
- Frosted glass cards stacked infinitely

**When glass works:** Sparingly, for specific UI moments (modals, overlays), when blur serves hierarchy.

### Shadows
- Identical drop shadows on every card
- Shadows that don't match a consistent light source
- Over-soft, over-large shadows that flatten hierarchy

**When shadows work:** Considered, varied by elevation, consistent light direction.

## Layout Clichés

### The Bento Box
- Every page is a grid of rounded-corner cards
- No hierarchy, everything is equally weighted
- Feels like a template with swapped content

**When grid layouts work:** With intentional hierarchy, varying card sizes, clear focal points.

### The Hero Problem
- Massive hero with generic headline and CTA
- Stock image or abstract 3D blob
- No personality, could be any company

**When heroes work:** When they establish a clear POV, use distinctive imagery, and justify their size with impact.

## Typography Clichés

### Trendy Font Convergence
- Space Grotesk everywhere
- Clash Display as the "bold choice"
- Whatever font is currently trending on every site

**Better approach:** Research what's current but choose based on concept fit, not popularity.

### Safe Defaults
- Inter for everything
- System fonts without consideration
- Roboto because it's there

**Better approach:** Earn your typography. Even a simple sans-serif should be chosen, not defaulted.

## Interaction Clichés

### Motion
- Everything bounces
- Identical ease-in-out on every transition
- Parallax for its own sake

**Better approach:** Motion should serve meaning. Baseline polish everywhere, hero moments intentionally.

### Hover States
- Everything scales up 5% on hover
- Color just swaps instantly
- No consideration for what the hover communicates

**Better approach:** Hover states should feel like feedback, not decoration.

## The "AI Aesthetic"

Signs of generic AI-generated design:
- Purple/blue gradient on white
- Perfectly centered, perfectly safe
- No tension, no surprise, no point of view
- Could be any product, any company
- Feels generated, not designed

**The fix:** Commit to a concept. Make decisions that couldn't be made by default. Have a point of view.

## Questions to Gut-Check

When reviewing work, ask:
1. Have I seen this exact combination on 10 other sites?
2. Could I swap the logo and this would work for a different company?
3. Is this a decision or a default?
4. What would a designer I respect think of this?
5. Is there anything here that surprises me?

If the answers are concerning, push harder.
